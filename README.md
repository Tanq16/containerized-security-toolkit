This project contains several Dockerfiles for ARM (Apple Silicon) and x86_64 variants of security focussed docker images. The main resources here are as follows &rarr;

- **Security Image** &rarr; An image that contains many security focussed tools
- **Minimal Security Image** &rarr; The minimal folder contains a security image with most tools and a lower image size
- **Threat Hunt Image** &rarr; An image that contains tools and for threat hunting

The images are built via GitHub Actions and pushed to Docker Hub for both x86-64 and ARM (built using [Buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/)) architectures.

The image is called `sec_docker` and multiple versions of it are uploaded as different tags, such as &rarr;

| | x86\_64 Image | ARM Image |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | `main` | `main_apple` |
| Security Minimal | `minimal` | `minimal_apple` |
| Threat Hunt | `thmain` | `thmain_apple` |

It has the [cli-productivity-suite](https://github.com/tanq16/cli-productivity-suite) preinstalled within the image. Executables, primarily Go-lang executables, are built and copied over from another image which is built once a month at the [tool_builder](https://github.com/tanq16/dockers_tool_builder).

The [wiki](https://github.com/Tanq16/containerized-security-toolkit/wiki) goes over using the pre-built images, building it with modifications, conventions considered when creating the Dockerfiles, and different ways it can be used.

A rundown of the [Quickstart](https://github.com/Tanq16/containerized-security-toolkit/wiki/1.-Quickstart) is as follows &rarr; 

There are several other nuances related to running the container, specifically around setting up single command functions to start and stop containers. Read the [wiki](https://github.com/Tanq16/containerized-security-toolkit/wiki), especially the [Example Workflow](https://github.com/Tanq16/containerized-security-toolkit/wiki/2.-Example-Workflow) for a better setup.

However, for a quick and dirty run, copy and paste the following commands in order &rarr;

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/docker_work/persist
```

```bash
docker run --name="security_docker" \
-v $HOME/docker_work/persist/:/persist \
-p 50022:22 --rm -d -it tanq16/sec_docker:main \
zsh -c "service ssh start; tail -f /dev/null"
```

```bash
docker exec -e newpp="docker" security_docker zsh -c 'echo "root:$(printenv newpp)" | chpasswd'
```

```bash
ssh root@localhost -p 50022
```

Finally, stop the container with the following &rarr;

```bash
docker stop security_docker -t 0
```

Containerized workloads for the win!
